## Instructions for Use 

The instructions for use are divided into the following two sections:

• Quick Start

This section is a user guide for newcomers to RT-Thread. By following simple steps, you can run the RT-Thread operating system on this development board and see the experimental results. 

• Advanced Use

This section is for developers who want to enable more development board resources on the RT-Thread operating system. By using the ENV tool to configure the BSP, you can enable more on-board resources and achieve more advanced functions.

## Quick Start 

This BSP currently only provides an MDK5 project. The following tutorial takes the MDK5 development environment as an example to introduce how to run the system.

**Compile and Download**

• Compile: Double-click the **project.uvprojx** file to open the MDK5 project and compile the program. 

• Download: Click the Debug button in MDK to download and debug 

**Running results**

After the program is downloaded successfully, the system will automatically run and print system information.

Connect the corresponding serial port of the development board to the PC, open the corresponding serial port (115200-8-1-N) in the terminal tool, reset the device, and you can see RT-Thread’s output information. Enter the help command can view the commands supported by the system.

**Application Entry Function**

The entry function of the application layer is in **bsp\renesas\ra6m3-hmi-board\src\hal_entry.c** in `void hal_entry(void)`. Source files that you created can be placed directly in the src directory.

```
void hal_entry(void)
{
    rt_kprintf("\nHello RT-Thread!\n");

    while (1)
    {
        rt_pin_write(LED3_PIN, PIN_HIGH);
        rt_thread_mdelay(500);
        rt_pin_write(LED3_PIN, PIN_LOW);
        rt_thread_mdelay(500);
    }
}
```

**ENV Configuration**

• How to use the ENV tool: [RT-Thread env tool user manual](https://www.rt-thread.io/document/site/programming-manual/env/env/). 

This BSP only enables the function of UART9 by default. If you're looking for more advanced functions such as components and software packages, ENV tool for configuration is available.

The steps are as follows:

1. Open the env tool under bsp.
2. Enter the `menuconfig` command to configure the project, and save and exit after configuration.
3. Enter the `pkgs --update` command to update the software package.
4. Enter the `scons --target=mdk5` command to regenerate the project.

**FSP Configuration**

*   How to Use FSP: [Configuring Peripheral Drivers for RA Series Using FSP](https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/#/rt-thread-version/rt-thread-standard/tutorial/make-bsp/renesas-ra/RA系列使用FSP配置外设驱动?id=ra系列使用-fsp-配置外设驱动)

The current repository's BSP is configured with the minimum footprint enabled by default. Users can enable peripheral configurations through the following steps:

1. Open the `env` tool in the BSP directory and use the `scons --target=mdk5` command to generate an MDK project.
2. Open the `project.uvprojx` file in the BSP directory, select the `Software Components` configuration in the top navigation bar, and open the configuration button next to `RA Configuration` under `Flex Software`. This operation will automatically detect the installed FSP version on the current computer. After selecting the specified version, enter FSP.

3. Upon entering FSP, pre-configured peripherals are already present. Click the `Generate Project Content` button to generate the required driver files.

4. Return to `env`, enable the necessary peripheral configurations, save, and exit.
